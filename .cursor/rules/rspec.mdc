# RSpec guidelines

- Please write all test cases using RSpec
- Use FactoryBot instead of Fixtures
- Use Faker with FactoryBot
- Do not directly test private methods, but ensure that they are fully tested indirectly via tests on public methods
- Prefer Rspec request/feature tests over plain controller tests. Try to maintain compatibility with RSwag/OpenAPI
- Do not change any Gem versions if tests fail
- Do not test using `render_template` - check content via something like `expect(response.body).to include('content')
- Don't get stuck in a rabbit-hole or failing cycle. If you get stuck, please stop and ask for help
- We should be aiming for full coverage of all models, controllers, policies, helpers, jobs, and routes.
- In most cases, any changes/removals/additions to implementation code should have corresponding tests
- The goal is 100% coverage for all models, requests, helpers, services, policies, and routes.
- Do not use outdated testing practices like checking for `assigns()` or `render_template`
