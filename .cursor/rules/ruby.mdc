# Ruby Guidelines

- Follow best practices for Ruby 3.4 and Rails 8
- Use modern, idiomatic Ruby and Rails patterns and syntax
- Be aware that Rubcop and Brakeman will run on all code generated
- Prefer methods like `attribute` and `attr_accessor` over explicit getter and setter methods
- Ensure implementation code is easy to test with RSpec
- Assume a non-thread-safe runtime environment
- Adequate testing is vital. The goal is 100% coverage for all models, requests, helpers, services, policies, and routes.
