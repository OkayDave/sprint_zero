# SprintZero

**Kickstart your next Rails project with sensible defaults and a curated setup.**

SprintZero is a boilerplate Ruby on Rails application designed to save time and effort when starting a new project. It comes pre-configured with modern defaults and carefully selected tools so you can get straight to building your app â€” not configuring it.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Ruby 3.4.2** & **Rails 8.0.2**
- **SQLite3** for development database
- **Turbo** and **Hotwire** enabled out of the box
- **Bulma** CSS framework for sleek and responsive UIs
- **HAML** templating for cleaner view code
- **Brakeman** and **Rubocop** for security and linting
- **Rspec and friends** for robust testing

## ðŸ”§ Why SprintZero?

Setting up a new Rails application can often feel repetitive â€” setting up the same gems, tweaking the same config files, installing the same frameworks. SprintZero removes that friction. Clone it, rename it, and you're off.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OkayDave/sprint_zero.git your_new_app_name
cd your_new_app_name
bin/setup
bin/dev
```

### Setting Up Your Repository

After cloning and setting up the project, you'll want to set up your own repository:

```bash
# Remove the original remote
git remote remove origin

# Add your new repository as the origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git

# Push your code to the new repository
git push -u origin main
```

### Environment Configuration

This project uses [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) for environment configuration. After cloning the repository, copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You can then customise your local environment variables in `.env`. For more information about environment variable overrides, see the [dotenv documentation](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#what-other-env-files-can-i-use).

## ðŸ’¡ Contributing

Feel free to fork, clone, and make PRs. If there's a configuration or gem you think should be included, open an issue and let's discuss.

# Git Hooks

This project uses [overcommit](https://github.com/sds/overcommit) to manage Git hooks. When you first clone the repository, run:

```bash
bin/setup
```

This will set up your development environment, including:
- Installing dependencies
- Setting up the database
- Installing and configuring git hooks

The following pre-commit hooks are configured:
- RuboCop: Automatically fixes style issues and fails if there are unfixable issues
- RSpec: Runs the test suite and fails if any tests fail

If you need to bypass the hooks for a specific commit (not recommended), you can use:

```bash
OVERCOMMIT_DISABLE=1 git commit
```
