# SprintZero

**Kickstart your next Rails project with sensible defaults and a curated setup.**

SprintZero is a boilerplate Ruby on Rails application designed to save time and effort when starting a new project. It comes pre-configured with modern defaults and carefully selected tools so you can get straight to building your app â€” not configuring it.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Ruby 3.4.2** & **Rails 8.0.2**
- **SQLite3** for development database
- **Turbo** and **Hotwire** enabled out of the box
- **Bulma** CSS framework for sleek and responsive UIs
- **HAML** templating for cleaner view code
- **Brakeman** and **Rubocop** for security and linting
- **Rspec and friends** for robust testing

## ðŸ”§ Why SprintZero?

Setting up a new Rails application can often feel repetitive â€” setting up the same gems, tweaking the same config files, installing the same frameworks. SprintZero removes that friction. Clone it, rename it, and you're off.

# Git Hooks

This project uses [overcommit](https://github.com/sds/overcommit) to manage Git hooks. When you first clone the repository, run:

```bash
bin/setup
```

This will set up your development environment, including:
- Installing dependencies
- Setting up the database
- Installing and configuring git hooks

The following pre-commit hooks are configured:
- RuboCop: Automatically fixes style issues and fails if there are unfixable issues
- RSpec: Runs the test suite and fails if any tests fail

If you need to bypass the hooks for a specific commit (not recommended), you can use:

```bash
OVERCOMMIT_DISABLE=1 git commit
```
